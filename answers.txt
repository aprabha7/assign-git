• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
When we try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together.

• Why should you have different branches?
helps developers to work parallely by branching out from original code.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
as many as remotes we want. but only one remote name 'origin'
